                <h1>a new era (for me)</h1>
                <p>i have never had a website. although it seems to be a fun side-project.</p>
                <p>recently i was recommended to buy a domain, so i did. and thats how i bought this domain. if you are wondering how i host this website i use github pages with my domain. you can do nearly anything with css, html and js. it all creates a palette and you have the paintbrush (if you know what to do).</p>
                <p>thats all i have to say in this blog post.</p>
